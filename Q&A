How QT receives eventKeyPress?

  The main window is a QGraphicsView, which is a QWidget. If you only have one widget open, all events will go to that widget by default(you can "focus" even a widget, to make THAT widget recieve events). In this case we only have a single window open, the QGraphicsView, so when we press a key, qt implicitly tells the window what key was pressed. And then the window passes the messege to the scene and the scene to its currently focused item.

Change the color of the rectangle?

  QBrush brush(Qt::blue);
  QGraphicsRectItem* someRect = new QGraphicsRectItem(0,0,100,100);
  someRect->setBrush(brush);

Scrolling background, much Touhou, such Remilia (Tutorial 7)?

  Here is a general approach to achieving a scrolling background using 3 identical images:
  -find or make an image that tiles horizontally or vertically (depending on whether your background will be moving horizontally or vertically)
  -if you want vertical scrolling, spawn one of these images and use a QTimer to slowy move it down
  -at the same time, spawn another image right ontop of this one
  -when the first image gets to the bottom of screen, move it back on top of the other 2 (or more generally, whenever any of these images gets to the bottom of the screen, move it back on top
  
  *key thing: the images must always be moving down, but when they reach the bottom of the screen, simply relocate them back to the top

How to have my images/sprites blend properly with background (Tutorial 8)?

  The easiest way to do that would be to use an image format that supports "alpha channels" such as .png. (.jpg or .jpeg does NOT support alpha channels). Supporting alpha channels basically means that those images can have regions that are transparent. So in other words, images saved in a .png format (or another alpha channel supporting format) can have regions that are transparent. Your images have "white" in them, as part of the image. What you need to do is, open them up in an image editing software (such as GIMP (free to download) or photoshop (costs) if you have it) and erase the "white." In gimp, the easiest way to do this is to open up your image and use the "fuzzy select" tool to click on the white background, then press the delete key on your keyboard to make it transparent. Then you simply clicked file->export as and save as .png :) Hope that helps!﻿
