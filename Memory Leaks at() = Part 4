The code still have memory leaks. The most important is the timer. A new timer is created each time a Bullet is created, but it is never deleted. A way to solve it is make the bullet the parent of the timer:

QTimer* timer = new QTimer(this)

The QObject hierarchy will delete it automatically when the bullet is deleted. Also make timer pointer a member of the class Bullet. When the bullet escapes from the scene, it should stop the timer:

	if ( y() + rect().height() < 0 )
	{
   timer->stop();
   scene()->removeItem(this);
   this->deleteLater();
}

The bullet is a QObject and it may have pending events in the event queue. Use the method deleteLater() instead of the operator 'delete this'.
